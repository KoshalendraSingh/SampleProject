## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java** (version 8 or later)
- **Maven** (version 3.6 or later)
- **Google Chrome** (Ensure Chrome is installed for the tests)
- **ChromeDriver** (Managed automatically by WebDriverManager)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all necessary project dependencies using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

This command downloads the required dependencies specified in the `pom.xml` file and compiles the project.

## Running Tests

You can run the entire test suite using Maven. The test runner is configured to execute the scenarios defined in the feature files.

```bash
mvn test
```

### Running Tests with Tags

Tags allow you to run specific scenarios or groups of scenarios. Tags are defined in the feature files.

#### Example Feature File with Tags

**`SignUp.feature`**

```gherkin
@signup @positive
Feature: Sign Up functionality

  @positive
  Scenario: Successful Sign Up with unique email
    Given the user is on the Create Account page
    When the user enters "John" in the first name field
    And the user enters "Doe" in the last name field
    And the user enters a unique email in the email field
    And the user enters "Password123!" in the password field
    And the user enters "Password123!" in the confirm password field
    And the user scrolls to the Create an Account button
    And the user clicks the Create an Account button
    Then the user account should be created successfully

  @negative
  Scenario: Sign Up with mismatched passwords
    Given the user is on the Create Account page
    When the user enters "John" in the first name field
    And the user enters "Doe" in the last name field
    And the user enters a unique email in the email field
    And the user enters "Password123!" in the password field
    And the user enters "Password456!" in the confirm password field
    And the user scrolls to the Create an Account button
    And the user clicks the Create an Account button
    Then the user should see an error message for mismatched passwords
```

#### Modify Test Runner to Use Tags

To run scenarios with specific tags, modify the `tags` option in the `TestRunner.java` file:

**`TestRunner.java`**

```java
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    features = "src/test/resources/features",
    glue = "stepdefinitions",
    plugin = {"pretty", "html:target/cucumber-reports"},
    monochrome = true,
    tags = "@positive" // Specify the tags you want to run
)
public class TestRunner {
}
```

#### Running Tagged Tests from Command Line

You can also specify tags when running tests from the command line:

```bash
mvn test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @positive"
```

This command runs all scenarios tagged with `@positive`.

## WebDriver Management

WebDriver is managed automatically using `WebDriverManager`. The driver is initialized before each test scenario and closed afterward to ensure a clean environment.



## Viewing Test Reports

After running the tests, view the test report generated by Cucumber in the `target/cucumber-reports` directory. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the results.
